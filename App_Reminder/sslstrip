A client's web-browser would know if the website is "https" only by checking if the website is listed in it's HSTS pre-loading list.

As you mentioned, in a classic scenario, a MITM could intercept an http GET request and prevent the redirection to the https version of the website.

This is why HSTS pre-loading was invented : browsers can verify if the visited website is in its HSTS pre-load lists. If it is the case, it will query the https version immediately, without trying the http first. This mitigates the MITM scenario
