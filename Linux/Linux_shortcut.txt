## cannot recognize or capture http  ##
I encountered a problem when running wireshark to monitor data flow in/from my computer on ubuntu.
<br>I could capture http requests or responds, but they are all texts and there was only a "success/n" in it.  When I use the filter on http, most of the packets were OCSP. </br>
<br>I also went to edit->preference->protocols->http, SCTP ports was 80 and ssl/tls ports was 443. wireshark returned normal http packets for a while when i set ssl/tls ports to 80, but then wireshark crashed. After i reopened it, no more normal http (html,png,etc.) packets again.
</br>I have no idea what is going on, can anyone help me out?</br>
<br>Also, I couldn't run wireshark even if i login in as root. It said that im unprivileged user; so i went to init.lua and turned off lua warning. im not sure whether it has impact on the capturing or not.</br>
<br>Im sorry I couldn't upload any pictures, the website says i dont have enough reputation points...
